1. Create a class named "Product" with the following properties: "Name" (string), "Price" (decimal), and "Description" (string).
2. Instantiate a few objects of the "Product" class and populate them with some sample data.
3. Implement a method to serialize the objects into an XML file. The XML file should have a root element (e.g., "Products") 
and each object should be represented as a child element with its properties as attributes or child elements.
4. Test your serialization method by calling it with the objects you created and verify that the XML file is generated correctly.
